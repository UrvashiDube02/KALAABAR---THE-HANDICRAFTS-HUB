**ABSTRACT**

The company as the name suggests is aiming at KALAA that means art. Just like the existing companies it is also an online shopping company at present but has an additional pick-up service available at present. The company works on the principle of ‘VOCAL FOR LOCAL’. As our honorable prime minister Mr. Narendra Modi grabbed our attention towards the phrase, he wanted the people of our country to be self - reliant as much as possible. Instead of using the imported products, we should use more of the local products and focus much on the GDP of our country. getting inspired from the golden words, KALAABAR promotes Vocal for Local. It sells the local handmade products made by the artisans of our country. Along with the phrase, the company has also decided to give a chance to the artisans as well, the one who have been wasting their talent. Having a platform like this, it would be an opportunity to the talented people of our country to earn from their talent as well. Making the handicrafts at home itself and giving it to our company, would be the perfect setup for success to both the artisans as well the country.
